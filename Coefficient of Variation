VAO = float(ASQ) * float(PAO) #sets VAO to the product of ASQ and PAO

    #Worst Outcome 
DWO = int(ACWO) - int(TEXR) #sets DWO to the difference of ACWO and TEXR
WSQ = int(DWO)**2 #sets WSQ to the square of DWO
VWO = float(WSQ) * float(PWO) #sets VWO to the product of WSQ and PWO


#Part 3
    #Calculate Variance
Variance = float(VBO) + float(VAO) + float(VWO) #sets variance to the sum of VBO, VAO, and VWO
